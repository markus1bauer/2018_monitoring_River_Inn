    <abstract>River restoration is widely applied, although its effects are poorly understood, and degraded hab-
itats might be difficult to improve. Moreover, there is a lack of monitoring as well as few system-
atic comparisons of restoration methods. This study presents results of a 4 - year monitoring on
River Inn (southern Germany) investigating restoration by gravel or sand addition or embankment
removal. The results were compared with reference sites that represent the pre - restoration
conditions. At the landscape scale, we analysed vegetation types based on aerial photographs,
whereas at a smaller scale, we undertook vegetation surveys and evaluated species composition,
growth, and life form, as well as the proportion of the target vegetation. After 4 years, the data
indicated a 'negative resilience' of the vegetation back to the state prior to restoration. The struc-
tural analysis revealed an extensive spread of reed at expense of bare soil. Thus, the species com-
position largely regressed to the pre - restoration conditions, and neither annuals nor other
pioneer species showed a long - term benefit of river restoration. There were differences among
the three restoration treatments after 2 years, but no longer after 4 years. However, the river res-
toration had three positive outcomes: (a) There was a temporary benefit for pioneer vegetation
that most likely replenished the seed bank of the respective species, (b) the valuable reed commu-
nities showed resilience, and (c) the measures allowed some practical learning as expected for
adaptive restoration.</abstract>
